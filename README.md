# MIPS Pipelined Processor

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a **5-stage pipelined MIPS processor** using **VHDL**, designed to execute MIPS instructions efficiently by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. The processor is modeled with a focus on achieving high performance through instruction-level parallelism while handling hazards such as data dependencies and control flow changes.

## **Features**
- **5 Pipeline Stages**:
  1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**: Fetches instructions from memory.
  2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**: Decodes instructions and reads register values.
  3. **Execute (EX)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
  4. **Memory Access (MEM)**: Reads or writes data to memory.
  5. **Write Back (WB)**: Writes results back to registers.

- **Hazard Detection and Resolution**:
  - **Data Hazards**: Implemented forwarding and stall mechanisms to resolve dependencies between instructions.
  - **Control Hazards**: Utilized branch prediction and pipeline flushing to handle branch instructions effectively.

- **Register File**: 32 general-purpose registers (R0â€“R31) with two read ports and one write port for concurrent access.

- **Instruction Set Support**:
  - Arithmetic: `ADD`, `SUB`
  - Logical: `AND`, `OR`
  - Branch: `BEQ`, `BNE`
  - Memory: `LW`, `SW`.

- **RTL Design Principles**: Designed using structural modeling to ensure accurate timing and synthesis compatibility.

## **Design Components**

### 1. **Pipeline Stages**
Each stage is implemented as a separate module in VHDL to enhance modularity and maintainability.

### 2. **Hazard Detection Unit**
Detects data dependencies between instructions and inserts stalls or bypasses data as needed.

### 3. **Forwarding Unit**
Implements forwarding paths to resolve data hazards and minimize pipeline stalls.

### 4. **Control Unit**
Generates control signals for all stages of the pipeline based on the decoded instruction.

### 5. **ALU**
Performs arithmetic and logical operations. Designed for efficient handling of MIPS instructions.

### 6. **Instruction and Data Memory**
Memory modules are implemented as separate blocks to simulate instruction fetches and data accesses.
